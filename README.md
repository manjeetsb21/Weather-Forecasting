# Weather Forecasting Using ARIMA Models

This repository contains a Python-based project that leverages ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for weather forecasting. By analyzing historical weather data, the project predicts future weather patterns with enhanced precision through careful parameter tuning and rigorous evaluation methods.

## Project Overview

The primary focus of this project is to develop accurate weather forecasting models using time series analysis techniques. By utilizing ARIMA models, we aim to predict future weather conditions by identifying trends, seasonality, and patterns in historical data. This project also emphasizes model evaluation through Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and stationarity tests to ensure the reliability of the forecasts.

### Key Features:

- **ARIMA Model Implementation**: Developed ARIMA models for forecasting weather data, fine-tuning model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualized trends, seasonality, and patterns in historical weather data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights before model training.
- **Model Evaluation**: Applied Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of the ARIMA models and conducted stationarity tests using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test to validate the time series data.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecasting-arima.git
cd weather-forecasting-arima
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

1. **Historic Weather Data**: Ensure you have a dataset containing historical weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation). This data can be sourced from platforms like Kaggle or weather APIs.
2. **Preprocessing**: Place your dataset in the `/data` directory and modify the data loading script if necessary.

## Usage

### Step 1: Time Series Analysis
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the historical weather data to visualize trends and patterns. Run:

```bash
python time_series_analysis.py
```

This script will generate visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to help you understand the data's seasonality, trends, and patterns.

### Step 2: ARIMA Model Training
Train the ARIMA model on the preprocessed weather data. Run:

```bash
python arima_forecasting.py
```

This script will:
- Fit the ARIMA model on the training data.
- Adjust parameters (p, d, q) for model optimization.
- Forecast future weather data.

### Step 3: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the ARIMA model's performance using RMSE and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Run:

```bash
python model_evaluation.py
```

This script will:
- Calculate RMSE to measure forecast accuracy.
- Conduct the ADF test to ensure the time series data is sufficiently stationary.

## Results

The project will output:
- Time series plots with identified trends and patterns.
- Forecasted weather data.
- Model performance metrics such as RMSE and ADF test results.
